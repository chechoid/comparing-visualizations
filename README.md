# Comparing Visualizations

This post is inspired by a [discussion in LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paulvanderlaken_think-twice-before-plotting-your-boxes-activity-6899369243398193152-63Y0) about the good and the ugly about boxplots vs. the scatter plots posted by [Paul van der Laken, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/) in which he cites an article by [Nick Desbarats](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickdesbarats/) titled **"I've stopped using boxplots. Should you?"**, a very thought provoking piece that [you can read here](https://nightingaledvs.com/ive-stopped-using-box-plots-should-you/).

I've been challenged to compare a boxplot against a violin chart, and I'd also add a scatter plot just to see how it goes in terms of clarity.
